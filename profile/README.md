## Hi, we're the MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center (BIC) ðŸ‘‹

[**Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium**](https://motrpac.org) is a national research consortium
designed to discover and characterize the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects
of physical activity in humans.

### About MoTrPAC

The [first MoTrPAC paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30691-7) is now published in the journal
_Cell_, describing the entire MoTrPAC study. It includes the
human endurance and resistance training interventions, and the extensive animal study protocols. It lists all the
tissues collected and the analysis plan for those tissues. It also provides information on data dissemination, that will
be done through the MoTrPAC data hub. Check it out so you know what is coming!
