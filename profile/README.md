## Hi, we're MoTrPAC ðŸ‘‹

[**Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium**](https://motrpac.org) is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health. Preclinical and clinical studies will examine the systemic effects of endurance and resistance exercise across a range of ages and fitness levels by molecular probing of multiple tissues before and after acute and chronic exercise. This program is the largest targeted NIH investment of funds into the mechanisms of how physical activity improves health and prevents disease.

### About MoTrPAC

The [first MoTrPAC paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30691-7) is now published in the journal _Cell_, describing the entire MoTrPAC study. It includes the human endurance and resistance training interventions, and the extensive animal study protocols. It lists all the tissues collected and the analysis plan for those tissues. It also provides information on data dissemination, that will be done through the MoTrPAC data hub. Check it out so you know what is coming!

### About the Bioinformatics Center

The [MoTrPAC Data Hub portal](https://motrpac-data.org) is developed and maintained by the MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center (BIC). The BIC is run by the [Ashley](https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/about-us) and Wheeler labs at Stanford University. [Check out who we are](https://motrpac-data.org/team)!

#### Accessing Data

The MoTrPAC [young adult rat endurance training study data](https://motrpac-data.org/data-download) is now available to the public. This is in addition to the [limited young adult rat acute exercise study data](https://motrpac-data.org/data-access) made publicly available in the past. Please agree to the data usage terms and register for an account on the [Data Access](https://motrpac-data.org/data-access) page if you are interested in obtaining access to the limited rat acute exercise data. To receive updates when subsequent publicly accessible data become available, please [submit your inquiry](https://motrpac-data.org/contact) or contact the [MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center helpdesk](mailto:motrpac-helpdesk@lists.stanford.edu).
